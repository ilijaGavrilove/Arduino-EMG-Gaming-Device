# Arduino-EMG-Gaming-Device
 The repository contains code that allows you to play Google Dinosaur using an Arduino board and AD8232 using forearm muscle tension
Calibrate MY_MTF value with graph.py for yourself. Change PORT value to your COM-PORT.
MTF (Muscle Tension Force) is the name used in this project, referring to a conditional value sent to the computer COM port that measures the force of muscle tension and correlates with the microvolts in which the human EMG is measured.
